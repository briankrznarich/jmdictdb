#   This file is an example of the contents of config-pvt.ini.
#
#   config-pvt.ini is for settings that need to be kept private,
#   particularly the access credentials for the JMdictDB databases.
#
#   CAUTION:
#   config-pvt.ini should not be world readable: only the site
#   maintainer(s) should have write access and only they and the
#   webserver process should have read access.

# The following sections define the databases that can be
# opened by name by with the "svc=" url parameter for JMdictDB
# web pages.  The svc value used is the same as the section
# name sans the "db_" prefix.

# Each section name must be prefixed with "db_".  Each section
# must have at least the option:
#     dbname -- Name of database to open.
#
# Optional options are:
#     host -- Name or ip address of machine that database resides
#         on.  If not given, no "host" parameter will be passed to
#         postgresql resulting in use of the local database server.
#     user -- Username to use when connecting to database.  If not
#         given, the normal postgres username resolution procedure
#         will be used (.pgpass file, etc.)
#     pw -- Password for 'user'.  If not given, same considerations
#         as for 'user'.
#     sel_user -- Username for a user that has only "select"
#         priviledges in the database.  If not given, no login
#         will be done for the select-only user.
#     sel_pw -- Password for 'sel_user'.
#     session_db -- Name of the section in this file that contains
#         login information for the session database.
#
# Except for the db_session and db_jmdict sections which are mandatory,
# the example sections given below are commonly used ones.  You may not
# need them or may wish to add additional ones.  You'll obviously need
# to provide the correct passwords.
# ";" is a comment character (like "#").

  # The session database that contains authorized editors
  # details (required).
