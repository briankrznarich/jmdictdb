# config-pvt.ini is for settings that need to be kept private,
# particularly the access credentials for the JMdictDB databases.
# It should not be world readable: only the site maintainer(s)
# should have write access and only they and the webserver process
# should have read access.
#
# Placing these settings in a file separate from the main config.ini
# file allows the latter to be given more permissive access.
# Alternatively, you can place the settings that are in config-pvt.ini
# into config.ini, restrict access to that file approriately, and
# remove the config-pvt.ini file.
#
# The following sections define "services", a named collection of
# credentials for accessing particular databases.  Each section name
# consists of the service name prefixed with "db_".  (The prefic is
# to reduce that chance of name conflicts with other sections.
# Each section  must have at least the option:

#     dbname -- Name of database to open.
# Optional options are:
#     host -- Name or ip address of machine that database resides
#         on.  If not given, no "host" parameter will be passed to
#         postgresql resulting in use of the local database server.
#     user -- Username to use when connecting to database.  If not
#         given, the normal postgres username resolution procedure
#         will be used (.pgpass file, etc.)
#     pw -- Password for 'user'.  If not given, same considerations
#         as for 'user'.
#     sel_user -- Username for a user that has only "select"
#         priviledges in the database.  If not given, no login
#         will be done for the select-only user.
#     sel_pw -- Password for 'sel_user'.
#     session_db -- Name of the section in this file that contains
#         login information for the session database.
#
# Except for the db_session and db_jmdict sections which are mandatory,
# the example sections given below are commonly used ones.  You may not
# need them or may wish to add additional ones.

  # The session database that contains authorized editors
  # details (required).
