== INSTALLATION

Although this software was written and is maintained primarily
to support Jim Breen's JMdict and wwwjdic projects, you may
wish to install a local copy of this software to:

- Run a local JMdictDB server for your own use.
- Contribute development work to the JMdict project.
- Use or adapt the code to a project of your own.

This document describes how to setup a functional instance of
a JMdictDB server including loading dictionary data.

// On-going operation and maintenance is described in FIXME.

// Setting up an environment for development work on the JMdictDB
// code is described in FIXME.

=== Requirements

The code is currently developed and tested on Ubuntu Linux using
Apache as a web server and Postgresql as the database server.
The webserver should be configured to run Python CGI scripts.

Regarding Microsoft Windows:
Up to mid 2014 the code also ran and was supported on Microsoft
Windows XP.  However, lack of access to a Windows machine
has required dropping Windows support.  Please be aware that
lingering references to Microsoft Windows in this and other
documentation are outdated and unsupported.

JMdictDB requires Python 3; Python 2 is no longer supported
although the last working Python 2 version is available in
the code repository in the branch, "py2".

Some additional Python modules are also needed.  Version
numbers are the versions currently in use in the author's
development environment -- the software may work fine with
earlier or later versions, but this has not been verified.

  Python [3.6] (known not to work before 3.3).
  Additional Python packages:
    psycopg2-2.7.3 Python-Postgresql connector.
      http://initd.org/projects/psycopg2/
    ply-3.9 -- YACC'ish parser generator.
      http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/
    lxml-4.0.0 -- XML/XSLT library.  Used by xslfmt.py for doing
      xml->edict2 conversion.
    jinja2-2.9.6 -- Template engine for generating web pages.
  Postgresql [10.3] -- Database server
  Apache [2.4] -- Web server
  make [4.1] -- Gnu make is required if you want to use the provided
    Makefile's to automate parts of the installation.
  wget -- Used by Makefile.db to download the dictionary XML files.
    If not available, you can download the needed files manually.

=== Database Authentication

We use the term "database server" when referring to the entire
Postgresql instance.  JMdictDB uses multiple, separate databases
within the database server.  For example, the database "jmdict"
is typically the "production" database while database "jmnew" is
used for loading dictionaries from source files.  There may be
a "jmtest" database and so on.

Any program that accesses the database server needs a username
and possibly a password to do so.  The database server is
accessed by the JMdictDB system in two contexts:

- When cgi scripts are executed by the web server.

- When Postgresql and JMdictDB command line tools are run
by a user.  This includes their execution by the makefiles
during installation.

In the first case the cgi scripts will use database usernames
and passwords defined in the config-pvt.ini file which will
be described in more detail below.

In the second case, the database username and password may be
given on the command line, environment variables, or a .pgpass
file.  The last option is usually the most convenient and
secure and is the method documented below.  A detailed discussion
of Postgresql authentication methods is out of scope here but
<<note1>> provided some further references.

=== Editor Authentication

JMdictDB provides a separate, application-level authentication
scheme for web access.  Users can login as Admin, Editor or access
the system anonymously by not logging in.  The CGI scripts allow
anonymous users to submit unapproved edited or new entries, but
to approve or reject entries, a user must be logged in as an Editor.
A user logged in as Admin can additionally manage other users.

JMdictDB users and their access levels are store in a separate
separate database named "jmsess".  This database need only be
setup once.

== Procedure

Setting up a JMdictDB instance involves:

1. Download and unpack (or clone) the JMdictDB software
  into a local directory.

2. Configure the Postgresql database server.

3. Use the JMdictDB tools to load the database with dictionary data.

4. Configure the Apache web server.

5. Deploy the JMdictDB software.  This step installs the jmdictdb
  library package, command line programs and web/cgi scripts to
  locations independent of the code in the download directory
  allowing the latter to be changed or deleted without affecting
  the operation of the installed version.

6. Create a config.ini file for CGI settings

A makefile is provided that automates loading the database
(Makefile.db) and installing the JMdictDB software (Makefile).
It is presumed that there is a functioning Postgresql server
instance, and that you have access to the database server's
"postgres" account or some account with enough privileges to
create and drop databases.

=== 1. Getting the code

There are two main branches in the code:

- master: the latest version and the branch new development
  should generally be based on.
- edrdg: the version currently running at edrdg.org

Clone the JMdictDB repository at GitLab:

 $ git clone https://gitlab.com/yamagoya/jmdictdb.git <DEV>

or, you can download a tar or zip archive at:
[none]
* https://gitlab.com/yamagoya/jmdictdb

(The download button is just to the left of the green
Clone button.)

=== 2. Configure the Postgresql database server

==== 2.1. Provide access to the Postgresql server

JMdictDB accesses the Postgresql database using two dedicated
Postgresql database user accounts, by default named 'jmdictdb'
(for read-write access) and 'jmdictdbv' (for read-only access)
although they can be changed in Makefile.db.

Create a .pgpass file which will allow access to the
database server without the need to enter a password each
time a database command is run:

Choose passwords for the 'jmdictdb' and 'jmdictdbv' database
user accounts and determine the password (if one in needed)
for the 'postgres' user (or whatever the account specified
by PG_SUPER in Makefile.db is.)  This user is used when
creating the 'jmdictdb' and 'jmdictdbv' users.

In your home directory create a file named .pgpass with mode
600 and contents:

  localhost:*:*:postgres:xxxxxx
  localhost:*:*:jmdictdb:yyyyyy
  localhost:*:*:jmdictdbv:zzzzzz

where "xxxxxx", "yyyyyy" and "zzzzzz" are the passwords for the
database "super user" and the two JMdictDB access users respectively.
If you changed PG_SUPER replace 'postgres' above with the changed value.
This will prevent Postgresql from prompting you for passwords dozens
of times.

IMPORTANT: If the file mode is not 600 Postgresql will ignore
the file.

==== 2.2. Create the JMdictDB Postgresql users

  $ make -f Makefile.db init

You will be prompted for the password to use for the new 'jmdictdb' database account.  Use the same passwords as entered above in the ~/.pgpass file.

  Enter password for new role: yyyyyy
  Enter it again: yyyyyy

The same process is repeated for the 'jmdictdbv' account (use the zzzzzz
password this time.)

IMPORTANT: You need (and should) only do the 'make -fMakefile.db init'
step once when installing JMdictDB on a machine for the first time,
even if you install the JMdictDB software multiple times.

=== 3. Load the database

By default, the main "production" database is named "jmdict".
Other databases are used when loading data, for testing, etc.
The makefile targets that load data do so into a database
named "jmnew" so as to not damage any working database in
the event of a problem.  A make target, "activate" is
provided to move a newly loaded database to "jmdict".

The process is:

    $ make -f Makefile.db jmnew
    $ make -f Makefile.db xxx
      where "xxx" is one of loadjm (JMdict), loadne (JMnedict), loadkd
      (kanjidic2), loadex (Tatoeba examples).  Repeat for as many of the
      preceeding that you want to load.  Then as the last step:
    $ make -f Makefile.db postload

As a shortcut, the target `loadall` will do the above for all four of the
dictionaries.

CAUTION: No provision is made for concurrent access while loading
data; we assume that only the access to the database being
loaded is by the procedures used for the loading.  However, use of
databases *other* than the one being loaded (usually "jmnew") can
continue as usual during loading.

The above procedure loaded everything into the database "jmnew" so that if
something went wrong, the main production database, "jmdict", would not be
affected.  If everything went well you can do:

    $ make -f Makefile.db activate

That will rename the current "jmdict" database (if any) to "jmold"
and rename the "jmnew" database that was just loaded to "jmdict".

=== 4. Deploy the JMdictDB software

At this point you have three ways to make make the database
command line tools and and cgi web pages available:

1. Serve them directly from your development directory.
2. Install them to standard locations in your home directory.
3. Install them to standard system-wide locations.

Any or all of the above can be done and each install is independent
of the others.  In particular you can do development work in your
development directory while using a previous install to your user
directories as a reference, and an earlier system install to a
production location is available to all.  If you have no need
to do development work you can delete your development directory
after doing the install in either option #2 or #3.

We will describe only options #2 and #3 here; option #1 is described
in the DEVELOPMENT document.

The JMdictDB software is deployed system-wide by:

  # make -f Makefile install-sys

and for you as an individual user by:

  $ make -f Makefile install-user

Note that when installing system-wide you must execute the 'make'
command as a 'root' user with, for example, 'sudo'.

You can also leave out the "-f Makefile" part on those commands
since 'make' uses that file by default.

The 'install-sys' target will, by default, install to the following
locations:
[none]
* {blank}
+
[%autowidth]
|===
| Web files              | /var/www/jmdictdb/
| CGI scripts            | /var/www/jmdictdb/cgi-bin/
| Admin files            | /var/www/jmdictdb/lib/
| Command line programs  | /usr/local/bin/
| Python library modules | /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages/ [*]
|===

For 'install-user' the locations are:
[none]
* {blank}
+
[%autowidth]
|===
| Web files              | ~/public_html/
| CGI scripts            | ~/public_html/cgi-bin/
| Admin files            | ~/public_html/lib/
| Command line programs  | ~/.local/bin/
| Python library modules | ~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/jmdictdb/ [*]
|===
[small]#[*] -- The exact location is determined by Python.  X and Y are the major
and minor version numbers of the installed Python.#

For either target you can override the default locations by overriding
the appropriate 'make' variable.  WEBROOT controls the location of the
web components.  For example:

  # make WEBROOT=/srv/jmdictdb/ install-sys

will install the web components to /srv/jmdictdb/, srv/jmdictdb/cgi-bin/,
etc.  The locations of the non-web components (command line programs,
python library modules) are not altered.)

Next you will need to tell the Apache web server where to
find the web components and at what URL to serve them.

=== 5. Configuring the Apache webserver

For exposition we'll assume the JMdictDB pages will be served at
the url \http://myhost.org/jpdicts/ and that the JMdictDB web
components have been installed at the default location of
/var/www/jmdictdb/.

Create an Apache configuration section like the following:

    ScriptAlias /jpdicts/cgi/ /var/wwww/jmdictdb/cgi-bin/
    Alias       /jpdicts/     /var/wwww/jmdictdb/
    <Directory /var/wwww/jmdictdb/>
      AllowOverride All
      SetEnv LANG en_US.utf8
      Options Includes FollowSymLinks ExecCGI
      Require all granted
    </Directory>

This can go in the main Apache configuration file, or at most
sites, in a separate file in a configuration directory.  Refer
to the Apache documentation for specifics.

Restart the web server:

    # systemctl restart apache2

If you point your web browser to
\http://localhost/jpdicts/cgi/srchformq.py
you should see a JMdictDB page with an error message about
the config.ini file not being found.  Which is correct since
we've not set up a config file yet.

=== 6. Create a config.ini file for CGI settings

The config.ini contains settings used by the CGI scripts when serving
web pages.  At a minimum you'll need to provide settings that describe
each database you want to be accessible via the web.  There actually
may be two config files: config.ini containing general settings that
need and config-pvt.ini containing database credentials.

The config file(s) lives in the lib/ subdirectory of the directory
the JMdictDB web component was installed to.

Create a config.ini file (use the config.sample file
as a guide).  The config.ini file should go in the same directory
as the library files: in python/lib/ if you are serving the files
directly from the development directories, or in $(WEBROOT)/lib/
if you are installing the web files using 'make web' (or both).
The config.ini file should be readable by the web server process
and not readable by world (it will contain database passwords.)

In addition to the config.ini and xonfig-pvt.ini files, the lib/
directory is te default location for the cgi log file.  Not

.
You should now be able to go to the url corresponding to
srchform.py and do searches for jmdict entries.  The url
corresponding to edform.py will let you add new entries.
