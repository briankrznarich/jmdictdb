== Procedure to add or modify JMdictDB tags
This document describes the procedure for implementing a "global"
change to the JMdictDB tags -- that is, a change that will be
incorporated in the JMdictDB distribution and distributed to
all users of the JMdictDB software (both of them. :-)  This is in
contrast to a local tag change that can be made in the database
tables at a particular site.

There are two places that need changes:

  * the kw*.csv file(s) that define the tags values (section <<sec3>>),
  * a SQL database update script to propagate the changes to any
    existent databases (section <<sec4>>).

We assume you've set up a development environment per
link:dev.html[Development Environment].

=== 1. Create a git branch for the tag changes work
     $ cd <your development directory>
     $ git status

Git should say "working directory clean" or list only "untracked
files".

   $ git checkout master
   $ git checkout -b newtags

You can replace "newtags" with any branch name you want.

=== 2. Run the tests.

   $ cd tests
   $ ./runtests.py

If there are errors they should be fixed before continuing.
This will prevent confusing preexisting errors with errors
resulting from your tag changes.
[#sec3]
=== 3. Edit the appropriate csv file(s)
The kw*.csv files in jmdictdb/data/ are the canonical source
of static tag information in JMdictDB.

If you are adding a new tag, add a line defining the new tag to
the appropriate .csv file in jmdictdb/data/.  Each line consists
of either three or four tab-separated fields:

  id -- The next sequential number.
  kw -- A short abbreviation for the tag.
  descr -- A longer (but one line) description of the tag.  If the
    text contains any double-quote characters (") the entire descr
    text should be enclosed in double-quotes and each embedded
    double-quote should be doubled (ie, each " changed to "").
  ents -- Modififcations to the tag for use in an XML file.
    This field is present only in the files kwdial.csv, kwfld.csv,
    kwkinf.csv, kwmisc.csv kwpos.csv and kwrinf.csv.

If you are changing an existing tag, edit the appropriate
line.  Caution: in general the "descr" can be changed arbitrarily
but you should be cautious about changing the "kw" field
value as it may be referenced in the code and need corresponding
changes there are well.  A grep through all the .py
files for the text "XXX['kkk']" or "XXX_kkk" (where XXX is the
tag type, eg FREQ, POS, etc, and kw is the short abbreviation of
the tag (the value you want to change) may (but is not guaranteed to)
turn up such cases.

In particular the following tags are known to be referenced in the
jmdictdb code:

  FREQ (all), GINF ('eql','lit'), LANG ('eng'), MISC ('male','fem'),
  STAT (all), SRCT (all), XREF('see','ant')

There may be others.

Be careful that your editor is set to preserve tabs (including
trailing ones) when saving rather than replacing them with spaces.

==== 3.1 The "ents" value

Some of the csv files contain a fourth column, "ents" which describe
differences between the tag's use in the JMdictDB software and its
use in an XML file.

If the "ents" value is empty, then the tag will will be represented
as an entity in JMdict XML with an entity name that is the
same as the tag's "kw" value and an entity value that is the same
as the tag's "descr" value.  For JMnedict XML, the tag will be
neither recognized when parsing XML nor output when generating XML.

If the "ents" value is not empty, then it must be a JSON string
representing an object.  The object must contain items with the keys
"jmdict", "jmnedict" or both.  The "jmdict" item applies when
processing JMdict XML and if absent the effect is the same as
if the "ents" value was empty (the tag will be treated as an entity
in the XML).  The "jmnedict" item works similarly for JMnedict XML
(if absent the tag will *not* be treated as an entity in the XML.)

The value of each item should be 0, 1 or another object.  If 0,
the tag is neither recognized nor produced in the XML.  If 1,
the tag is recognized and produced as an entity in the XML.
Note that because tags are produced by default for JMdict and
not for JMnedict, an "ents" value of {"jmdict":1} is effectively
a no-op, as is {"jmnedict":0}.

If the value is another object, it must have the keys "e", "v" or
both.  If there is an "e" key, that item's value will be used for
the entity name in the XML rather than the tag's "kw" value.  If
there is  a "v" value, it will be used for the entity's value in
the XML rather than the tag's "descr" value.

Some examples from kwmisc.csv:

  5   col   colloquialism

This has no "ents" value and thus the entity ```&col;``` will be
recognized and produced in the JMdict XML but not in the
JMnedict XML.

  181   surname	  family or surname   {"jmnedict":1}

The ```&surname;``` entity will be recognized and produced in
the JMnedict XML.  It will also be recognized and produced
in the JMdict XML by default since it is not specifically
excluded with {"jmnedict":1, "jmdict":0}
....
  15   male  	male term, language, or name
    {"jmdict":{"v":"male term or language"},
     "jmnedict":{"e":"masc","v":"male given name or forename"}}

  [Note: above is line-wrapped for this document; would be a
   single line in the kwmisc.csv file.]
....
In this case the tag description ```male term, language, or name```
is used with within JMdictDB but in the JMdict XML, the value
of the ```&amp;male;``` entity will be ```male term or language.```  In
the JMnedict XML the entity name will be ```&masc;``` and its
value will be ```male given name or forename.```

[#sec4]
=== 4. Write a database update file to update existent databases
The csv files contain the canonical tag definitions and are
loaded into a jmdictdb database when it is first created but changes
made to the csv files afterwards are not automatically propagated
to existing databases -- that is done by the script you write here.

Generally, adding a new tag or changing a tag's description text
or entities (ents) value is simple.
Changing a tag's name (aka keyword) or deleting a tag is
more complicated because a history record needs to be created for
any entries that use the tag.  Were that not done, someone looking
at an entry's history in the future could be confused by the absence
of a tag that was shown as added in the past, or presence of a tag
with no earlier history showing its addition.
The cause may be obvious in the case of a single tag change but with
multiple changes over time it could be impossible to determine the
entry's history accurately.
Even if it is known that a particular database doesn't have any
entries using the tag, the update script has to be usable on *any*
database.

After the database has been updated the tag changes will automatically
appear in the Search and Help pages.

This procedure applies only to the change of tag changes that don't
require any change to the database schema or jmdictdb code.  If that
is not true, additional steps are required that are beyond the scope]
of these instructions.

==== 4.1 Procedure
Create a new database update file in db/updates/ named:

  nnn-xxxxxx.sql

where nnn is a sequential 3-digit decimal number (use the next highest
number from the update files already in db/updates/) and "xxxxxx" is
a random 6-digit hexadecimal number.  On way of generating it is to
use the command:

  python -c 'import random;print("%06.6x"%random.randint(0,16777215))'

Use this template for the contents of the new update file:

[source,sql]
----
\set ON_ERROR_STOP
BEGIN;

-- Comment summarizing the update
-- Additional comments providing more detail if needed.
-- [...]

\set dbversion  '''xxxxxx'''  -- Update version applied by this update.
INSERT INTO db(id) VALUES(x:dbversion::INT);

-- Do the update...

[sql statements to implement the update, as described below in
the following sections and Appendix A, go here.]

COMMIT;
----
Replace "xxxxxx" in the template with same "xxxxxx" you generated
above for the filename.  Replace the "[sql statements...]" lines
with the SQL statements needed to implement the changes.  See the
following sections for more details on that.

Note that the tag changes are done inside a transaction: if there
is an error when you run the script the database is left unchanged
so you can simply correct the error and rerun -- no need to undo
a partially applied update.

==== 4.2. Add a new tag
For adding new tags use a simple INSERT statement.  For tables *other
than* kwdial, kwfld, kwkinf, kwmisc, kwpos or kwrinf:

  INSERT INTO <table-name>
  VALUES (<id-number>, '<tag-name>', '<description>');

<table-name> is the same as the kw*.csv filename sans the ".csv"
extension.
<id-number> is the id number of the new tag, <tag-name> is the short
tag name, and <description> is a single line longer description.  All
three values should be the same as in the csv file (sans quotes as
mentioned next).

Both <tag-name> and <description> must be enclosed in single quotes.
If there is a single quote (') in the text it should be doubled ('').
If you copied the text from the csv file un-double any doubled double
quotes ("" -> ").

For tables kwdial, kwfld, kwkinf, kwmisc, kwpos or kwrinf, the
statement is similar but has an additional "ents" field.  Its
value is the same text as used in the corresponding .csv file.
If the value is empty in the .csv file replace '<ents>' below
with NULL (without single quotes).

  INSERT INTO <table-name>
  VALUES (<id-number>, '<tag-name>', '<description>', '<ents>');

==== 4.3. Tag description or entities (ents) change
Change a tag's description text using a SQL UPDATE statement:

  UPDATE kwpos SET descr='<new description>'
    WHERE kw='<tag-name>' AND descr='<old description>'

Note that if a single-quote (') occurs within the description
text it needs to be doubled ('').

A similar statement works for changing the "ents" value:

  UPDATE kwpos SET ents='<new ents value>'
    WHERE kw='<tag-name>' AND descr='<old description>'

Per the usual SQL rules both can be changes together:

  UPDATE kwpos
    SET descr='<new description>', ents='<new ents value>'
    WHERE kw='<tag-name>' AND descr='<old description>'

==== 4.4 Tag name change or tag deletion
The SQL for these cases is a little more complicated due to the
aforementioned need to create a history record.  Please refer
to Appendix A for the appropriate SQL.

=== 5. Test on a copy of the production database:
Make copy of the production database and apply the update to it:

  $ dropdb <dev-database-name>
  $ createdb -Ojmdictdb <dev-database-name>
     # Following statement assumes production database is named "jmdict".
  $ pg_dump jmdict | psql -d <dev-database-name>
  $ psql -d <dev-database-name> -Ujmdictdb -f patches/nnn-xxxxxx.sql

Do any ad hoc testing needed to confirm the changes are as expected,
(eg generate the jmdict and jmnedict XML files, use the web interface
to edit some entries with the new/changed tags, etc.)

=== 6. Apply the database update to the test database:
  $ cd tests
  $ ./load-testdb.py data/jmtest01.sql
  $ psql -d jmtest01 -Ujmdictdb -f ../db/updates/nnn-xxxxxx.sql

Run the tests again:

  $ ./runtests

Errors here from test_kwds like indicate that the changes made by
database update are not consistent with the .csv files.  If there
were any errors, restore the original test database file:

  $ git checkout -- data/jmtest01.sql

Repeat the above steps until the update applies cleanly and all the
tests pass.  Then, save the updated jmtest01 database:

  $ pg_dump jmtest01 >python/tests/data/jmtest01.sql

=== 7. Commit the changes:
  $ git status

should list as modified any of the kw*.csv and ddtd-*.xml files
that were modified and the jmtest01.sql file.  It should also list
the new nnn-xxxxxx.sql file as "untracked".
Assuming there are no unexpected files listed:

  $ git add db/updates/nnn-xxxxxx.sql
  $ git add -u    # Adds the modified files
  $ git commit
  [enter the commit message in the editor]

=== 8. Update production code and database
After the I've pulled the changes I'll update the edrdg branch on
GitLab and the production database can be updated:

  $ cd <dev directory>
  $ git checkout edrdg
  $ git pull edrdg    # This gets the current version, including your
                      # changes from Gitlab
    # Update the production database
  $ psql -d jmdict -Ujmdictdb -f patches/nnn-xxxxxx.sql
  (as root) # make ... web
  $ git branch -d newtags   # You can delete your branch since your
                            # changes are now in the main edrdg branch.

[#appendix_a]
== Appendix A -- SQL to change or delete tags
In order to minimize the complexity of the SQL used to change or
delete tags, we use statements that are not "safe" in the presence
of other simultaneous transactions affecting the same entries or tags.
It is safest to run these  SQL statements in a quiescent database
without other concurrent activity.

In the SQL snippets callouts indicate lines containing parameters in
angle brackets that need to be replaced with actual values:

<1> <id> -- Id number of the tag to be updated or deleted.
<2> <new-tag-name> -- New name the tag is to be given.

=== FREQ tag
The FREQ tag values are referenced from the jmdictdb code
and in some SQL views in conjunction with determining the 'P'
(popular) attribute for an entry.  Changing or deleting
existing FREQ tags is more involved than the simple recipes
this section provide for.

=== GINF tag

----
==== Delete tag
GINF tags unlike most of the others are mutually exclusive:
only one GINF tag can apply to any gloss and every gloss must
have a tag.  Thus it is not possible provide a universally
applicable delete script because we can't in general know
if any existing target glosses should be deleted or assigned
some other (and which) GINF tag.

=== SRCT tag
SRCT tags identify the particular corpus an entry belongs to
("jmdict", "jmnedict", etc.)
They are referenced extensively throughout the JMdictDB code base
and code changes are required in addtition to database changes to
modify them.

=== STAT tag
STAT tags describe the "status" of an entry (active, rejected,
deleted).
They are referenced extensively throughout the JMdictDB code base
and code changes are required in addtition to database changes to
modify them.

=== XREF tag
XREF tags are used to classify particular types of cross-references.
Two ("see" and "ant") are used in the "jmdict" and "jmnedict"
corpora although others are defined in kwxref.csv.
They are referenced extensively throughout the JMdictDB code base
and code changes are required in addtition to database changes to
modify them.
