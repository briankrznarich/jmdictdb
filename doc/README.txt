This directory contains documentation for the JMdictDB project.

Open index.html in your web browser for a list of links to
the JMdictDB documentation.

The "published" documention in this directory is primarily
html, pdf and for the database schema diagram, png, files.
Those that are generated are produced from files in subdirectory
src/, currently Open Office Writer, Asciidoc and for the schema
diagram, Dia files.

There is a Makefile to produce the product documents from the
source docs.

Historical note:
The first version of the database diagram was created with
postgresql_autodoc v1.40 but after intitial creation it was/is
maintained independently with Dia (an Open Source Visio-like
diagramming tool).
