pg/data/

The .csv files in this directory hold data for the jmdict
keywords.  This data is both loaded into the jmdictdb
database kw* tables, and loaded by some application code
that does not have/want to access a database.

Fields are separated with tab characters.  If a text field
contains a double-quote character, the entire field should
be enclosed in double quotes and the embedded double-quote
character(s) should be doubled:

  â—‹  1	ichi	"Ranking from ""Ichimango goi bunruishuu"", 1-2."
  X  1	ichi	Ranking from "Ichimango goi bunruishuu", 1-2.

The data in kwlang.csv was generated by tools/mklang.py
from the table of ISO-639-2 language codes downloadable
from:
 ISO-639-2 (1998) http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
See issue IS-110 for more details.

See file rad.txt for more information on the data on rad.csv.

*** IMPORTANT ***
The test python/tests/test_jdb_kwds.py includes explicit
tests for each id/kw pair defined in the csv files of this
directory (except for kwlang.csv, from which only a small
sample of entries are tested) and that file should be updated
in parallel when any changes are made to the csv files in
this directory.

*** IMPORTANT ***
The function jdb.std_csv_dir() (in module python/lib/jdb.py)
has the relative location of this data directory hardcoded
into it.  If this directory moves, that function needs to
be updated.
